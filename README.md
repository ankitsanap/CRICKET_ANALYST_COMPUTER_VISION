# CRICKET_ANALYST_COMPUTER_VISION
Cricket analysis using computer vision is a cutting-edge technology that uses machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to provide real-time analysis and insights during cricket matches. By detecting and tracking the movements of the ball, players, and umpires, the system can identify key events, such as boundaries and wickets, and provide statistical analysis of the game. Coaches and players can use this technology to gain a deeper understanding of the game and improve their strategies and techniques. Overall, cricket analysis using computer vision has the potential to revolutionize the way cricket is played and analyzed at all levels.

# Cricket analytics using computer vision for live field tracking of players involves various parameters that are essential to ensure accurate tracking and analysis. Here are some of the important parameters required:

Camera positioning: The positioning of cameras is crucial for accurate tracking of players. The cameras need to be placed in such a way that they capture the entire field of play and provide a clear view of each player.

Frame rate: The frame rate of the cameras should be high enough to capture fast-moving players and the ball accurately. A higher frame rate ensures that more information is captured, which helps in accurate tracking.

Resolution: The resolution of the cameras should be high enough to capture clear images of the players and the ball. Higher resolution ensures that even small details are captured, which can be helpful in analyzing player movements.

Image processing algorithms: Image processing algorithms are essential for analyzing the images captured by the cameras. These algorithms are used to detect and track players, the ball, and other objects on the field.

Machine learning models: Machine learning models are used to analyze the data captured by the cameras and provide insights into player performance. These models are trained on large datasets of cricket matches and are used to identify patterns in player movements, ball trajectory, and other aspects of the game.

Calibration: The cameras and the tracking system need to be calibrated before each match to ensure accuracy. This involves adjusting the camera angles, lens distortion, and other factors to ensure that the tracking system is accurate.

Data storage: The data captured by the cameras needs to be stored in a secure and reliable manner. This requires a robust data storage system that can handle large volumes of data and provide fast access to the data when needed.




# BUILDING MODEL

# Step 1: Data Collection
The first step is to collect data from cricket matches. This includes live video feeds from the matches, as well as data on player and team statistics. The data needs to be preprocessed and labeled to be useful for machine learning algorithms.

# Step 2: Object Detection
The next step is to use computer vision algorithms, such as Object Detection, to identify different objects in the video frames, such as players and the ball. This can be done using pre-trained models or custom models trained on the collected data.

# Step 3: Object Tracking
Once the objects are detected, Object Tracking algorithms can be used to track the movement of players and the ball across the video frames. This helps in analyzing player movements and ball trajectory.

# Step 4: Pose Estimation
Pose Estimation algorithms can be used to detect the posture of players, such as whether they are standing, running, or in a particular position like a bowler or a fielder. This helps in identifying the actions performed by players.

# Step 5: Action Recognition
Action Recognition algorithms can be used to recognize different actions performed by players, such as hitting the ball, catching it, or running. This helps in analyzing player performance and identifying areas for improvement.

# Step 6: Data Analysis
The data collected from the above steps can be analyzed using machine learning models to identify patterns in player movements, ball trajectory, and other aspects of the game. This helps in providing insights into player performance and optimizing team strategies.

# Step 7: Visualization
The results of the data analysis can be visualized using charts, graphs, and other visualizations. This helps in presenting the insights in an understandable and actionable way for coaches, players, and teams.

# These are the basic steps involved in building a model for cricket analytics using computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
